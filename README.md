# AIRIN
This file structure is built to replicate a github repository.  Similarly, it will be loaded into a github repository.
Each level is divided into logical regions of function, inspired by the human brain.  It is important to note, this is not following the human brain structure, nor is it intended to simulate the human brain.   This is a logical approach to the electrical and hardware structure of the processing units.  A good place to start.  There will likely be multiple iterations of this structure as technology becomes available, insights are gained, and funds become available.  
Throughout this project, an archive will be kept for keeping track of progress and as a back up of information, should a change lead to an unwanted consequence.  
Level 1 quadrants: Front, Back, Left, Right 
•	Each folder is respectively labeled.  Each quadrant is simply defined to establish a start point.  It does not represent a physical location in the “brain space”.  It represents a logical and easily identified theoretical space that can be referred to schematically and in terms simple enough for most people to follow.  
•	Front and Back are primary functions that will logically connect to the related secondary functions housed in Left and Right quadrants.     
Level 2 subs: Quadrant specific
•	Supporting documentation for each quadrant (folder) is housed in these folders.  Similarly broken down by hierarchy.
